## Overview

**MD Creative** is a smart event and booking management system built for a real entertainment business domain.

The project is designed to support both:

- the **public side** of the platform, where customers can explore services and booking options
- the **admin side**, where bookings, services, content, and operational data can be managed in a more organized way

This project goes beyond a basic CRUD exercise and is structured as a full-stack academic software engineering system with a realistic business use case.

---

## Project Goal

The main goal of the platform is to make event organization:

| Goal | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Easier | Customers can view multiple services in one place |
| Faster | Booking-related information is organized more efficiently |
| More flexible | Events can be customized through packages, mascots, decorations, and activities |
| More professional | The business side can manage services and bookings in a structured digital system |

Instead of handling every event service separately, the system aims to support a complete event-planning flow in one platform.

---

## Current Project State

The project has evolved significantly from its earlier version and now has a clearer and stronger structure.

### Current state summary

| Area | Current State |
|------|---------------|
| Backend | Organized, modular, and built with layered structure |
| Database | Main project logic is built around PostgreSQL-based modules |
| Frontend | Functional across the main pages and flows |
| UI/UX | Improved and visually cleaner than before |
| Project Structure | Updated and more professional than the earlier version |
| Documentation | Available in `docs/`, including the demo plan for live presentation |

### Important note

The frontend is no longer just a placeholder or an early prototype. It has been worked on page by page and now functions across the main parts of the project. The current version already works well and presents the system more clearly. In the future, the interface can still be made even more polished and visually advanced, but the present state is already usable, functional, and much stronger than before.

## Backend Architecture

The backend follows a layered structure to improve maintainability, readability, and separation of concerns.

### Request Flow

```text
Request → Route → Controller → Service → Repository → Database
```

### Layer Explanation

| Layer | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Routes | Define endpoints and connect middleware |
| Controllers | Receive requests and return responses |
| Services | Contain business logic and application rules |
| Repositories | Handle persistence and data access |
| Database / Storage | Store the application data |

This structure makes the project easier to expand, maintain, and improve.

---

## Frontend Structure

The frontend has been reorganized and improved compared to the earlier project state.

### Frontend Includes

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `assets` | Static files such as images and design resources |
| `components` | Reusable UI components |
| `context` | Shared application state and React context |
| `data` | Static or prepared frontend data sources |
| `hooks` | Custom React hooks |
| `layouts` | Public and admin layout structures |
| `mocks` | Mocked data used during development where needed |
| `pages` | Main pages of the application |
| `routes` | Frontend route organization |
| `services` | API communication logic |
| `types` | TypeScript type definitions |
| `utils` | Helper utilities |

### Frontend Status

The frontend currently works across the main pages of the project and is now in a much better state structurally and visually. The pages are functional, organized, and present the system more clearly. Future work may focus on making the design even more refined and visually stronger, but the current version is already a major improvement and is usable in its present state.

---

## Main Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Packages | Entertainment packages for events |
| Mascots | Mascot characters and related services |
| Decorations | Decoration service options |
| Activities | Additional children’s entertainment activities |
| Bookings | Reservation and booking flow |
| Gallery | Presentation of visual and event content |
| Authentication | Admin access and protected flows |
| Admin | Internal management of project data |

---

## Documentation

Project documentation is available in the `docs/` folder.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `architecture.md` | Explains the architecture of the system |
| `class-diagram.md` | Shows the class-level design and relationships |
| `demo-plan.md` | Contains the live demo plan, selected flow, presentation structure, detailed demo script, and Plan B |
| `implementation.md` | Describes implementation-related work |
| `project-audit.md` | Contains project audit analysis |
| `sprint-plan.md` | Documents sprint planning and work progress |
| `screenshots/` | Stores project screenshots used for documentation, demo support, and visual reference |

---

## Demo Preparation

The project includes a dedicated demo plan in:

```text
docs/demo-plan.md
```

The demo focuses on the main flow:

```text
Home Page → Packages → Booking Page → Admin Login → Admin Dashboard → Admin Packages / Admin Bookings
```

This flow was selected because it shows both sides of the system:

- the customer side, where users explore services and start a booking request
- the admin side, where the business manages data and booking-related operations

The demo plan also includes a backup approach using screenshots, documentation, and the prepared presentation in case any live technical issue appears during the presentation.

npm run dev
```

or

```bash
npm start
```

## Current Notes and Future Direction

### Current Notes

| Area | Note |
|------|------|
| Frontend | Functional and improved across all main pages |
| Backend | Organized with layered architecture |
| UI | Cleaner, stronger, and better organized than before |
| Demo | A complete demo flow is prepared in `docs/demo-plan.md` |
| Structure | Updated and more professional |
| Documentation | Should continue to stay aligned with future code changes |

### Future Direction

The current version of the project is functional and ready to be demonstrated. Future work can focus on extending and polishing the system even further, such as:

- more advanced UI/UX polish
- stronger validation and reliability improvements
- further consistency across all modules
- additional refinement in admin-side workflows
- email notifications after booking requests
- richer dashboard analytics
- future payment or deposit support
- even better visual presentation and interaction design

These are future extensions, not blockers for the current demo.
